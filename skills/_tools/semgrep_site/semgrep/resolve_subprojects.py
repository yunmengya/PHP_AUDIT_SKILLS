    Identify subprojects based on lockfiles and manifests and resolve their
    dependency information.

    The `config` argument controls the behavior of the
    dependency resolver:

    When `allow_local_builds` is False, dependencies are resolved only by
    parsing existing files (lockfiles and manifests).
    If `allow_local_builds` is True, this function may cause projects that
    are scanned to be built. This may involve:
    - Downloading packages from the internet
    - Executing code that is included in the scanned project or in downloaded
      packages

    If `ptt_enabled` is True, dependency resolvers that support dependency
    path will be prioritized.

    If `resolve_untargeted_subprojects` is False, only subprojects with
    dependency source files or relevant code files are resolved and the
    remaining subprojects are skipped.
    If `resolve_untargeted_subprojects` is True, this filtering is disabled and
    resolution is attempted for every found subproject.
    The list of rules is required in order to choose which subprojects to
    resolve and which can be skipped based
    on the set of targets reported by the `target_manager`.

    If `download_source` is True, dependency resolvers will attempt to download
    source code for each subproject's dependencies. For all currently supported
    package managers, this requires that `allow_dynamic_resolution` is also True.

    Returns a tuple with the following items:
